Program findOrfs.py reads a file of fasta sequences from STDIN, finds the unique subsequences
that occur in a single tRNA such that no members of this set occur among any of the other tRNA sets.
Program includes methods find uniquetRNA, essentialtRNA, fastAreader, and main:
    uniquetRNA: finds the unique tRNA sequences.
    essentialtRNA: finds the essential tRNA sequences from the unique sequences.
    fastAreader: reads a file of fasta sequences from STDIN.
    main: prints out header, sequence, and essential sequences of each tRNA
