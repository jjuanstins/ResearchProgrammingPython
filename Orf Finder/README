Program findOrfs.py includes modules CommandLine and main.
CommandLine class creates a comand line program that allows user interface that is accessed 
through the terminal winder. 
Main class instantiates the OrfFinder module from sequenceAnalysis.py and prints out ORF info.


Program sequenceAnalysis.py is essentially a toolkit that inclues modules that are helpful
in analysis of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. 
    Modules include:
        OrfFinder: finds and stores open reading frames in a sequence.
        NucParams: the module counts the number of nucleotides, codons, and amino acids of a given 
        sequence and stores the information in respective dictionaries. 
        ProteinParams: the module analyzes a given protein sequence, and returns the information.
        FastAReader: the module opens and reads a FastA file.
