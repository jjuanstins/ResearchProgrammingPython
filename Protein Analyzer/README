The program reads and calculates the physical-chemical properties of a user input
protein sequence. The program will read in the protein sequence and print out the
following: number of amino acids and total molecular weight, molar extinction 
coefficient and mass extinction coefficient, theoretical isoelectric point (pI), 
and amino acid composition.


Example:
    Input: VLSPADKTNVKAAW
    Outpur: Number of Amino Acids: 14
            Molecular Weight: 1499.7
            molar Extinction coefficient: 5500.00
            mass Extinction coefficient: 3.67
            Theoretical pI: 9.88
            Amino acid composition (in seperate lines): A = 21.43% C = 0.00% D = 7.14% 
            E = 0.00% F = 0.00% G = 0.00% H = 0.00% I = 0.00% K = 14.29% L = 7.14% M = 0.00% 
            N = 7.14% P = 7.14% Q = 0.00% R = 0.00% S = 7.14% T = 7.14%  V = 14.29% W = 7.14% 
            Y = 0.00%
