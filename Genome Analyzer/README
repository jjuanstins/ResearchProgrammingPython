genomeAnalyzer.py program imports classes NucParams and FastAreader from sequencAnalysis module, 
calculates and prints out the sequence length, G and C nucleotide content, and relative codon 
frequency and codon count for each codon from a fastA file.

Sequence length: total length of genome sequence (sum of all nucleotides). 
GC content: number of G + C nucleotides divided by the total number of all nucleotides.
Codon fequency: number of particular codon divided the number of amino acid of which the codon codes for.
