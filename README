This repository is a showcase of projects done in the course Research Programming in the Life Sciences at UCSC. 
I would like to acknowledge Dr. David Bernick at UCSC for guidance and creation of the labs/assignments.
I would also like to thank student tutor Emily Mount and TAs Elizabeth DeVogelaere and Dennis Mulligan for their help on my 
programs and for answering my ever annoying questions.
